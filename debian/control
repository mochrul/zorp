Description: Advanced protocol analyzing firewall
 Zorp is a new generation firewall. It is essentially a transparent proxy
 firewall, with strict protocol analyzing proxies, a modular architecture,
 and fine-grained control over the mediated traffic. Configuration decisions
 are scriptable with the Python based configuration language.
 .
 Zorp has been successfully deployed in demanding environments like the
 protection of high traffic web sites, or the protection of large intranets.
 Since the protocol analysis is strict and many of the common exploits
 violate the application protocol they are injected into, a large percentage
 of the attacks do not cross a Zorp based firewall even if the given service
 is permitted.

Description: Default proxy modules for Zorp
 Zorp is a new generation firewall. It is essentially a transparent proxy
 firewall, with strict protocol analyzing proxies, a modular architecture,
 and fine-grained control over the mediated traffic. Configuration decisions
 are scriptable with the Python based configuration language.
 .
 This package includes proxies for the protocols: FINGER, FTP, HTTP,
 SSL, TELNET, WHOIS, and two general modules ANYPY and PLUG.
